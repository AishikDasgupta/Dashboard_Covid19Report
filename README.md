#Description
Welcome to my GitHub repository for a COVID-19 dashboard report made using CSV and Power Bi using data visualization. The report provides insights into the COVID-19 situation in a specific region/country. It includes visualizations that show the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. The report also includes visualizations that show the trend of COVID-19 cases over time and their impact on the region/country. The report is created using Power Bi, which allows for interactive data exploration and analysis.
